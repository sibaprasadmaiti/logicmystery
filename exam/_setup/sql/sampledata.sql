We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write ‘Tough and Competent’ on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee.

There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known. The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 26px; margin: 36px 0px 24px; color: rgb(26, 26, 26); line-height: 32px; font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;The Earth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; color: rgb(56, 56, 56); font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;every human being&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 24px; margin: 36px 0px 24px; color: rgb(26, 26, 26); line-height: 30px; font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Houston&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; color: rgb(56, 56, 56); font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;that may have seemed like a very long final phase.

It was hard to think that that little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars, pestilence don’t show from that distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 24px; margin: 36px 0px 24px; color: rgb(26, 26, 26); line-height: 30px; font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Flight Control&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; color: rgb(56, 56, 56); font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: ‘Tough’ and ‘Competent.’ Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write ‘Tough and Competent’ on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px 48px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(56, 56, 56); font-family: &#039;Open Sans&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; padding-left: 6px; margin-bottom: 12px;&quot;&gt;It’s just mind-blowingly awesome.
